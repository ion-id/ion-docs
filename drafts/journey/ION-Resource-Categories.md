| ION Name | Short Code | GPC L0 Mapping | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fashion & Accessories | `TRC-fashion` | Apparel & Accessories | ACTIVE | Clothing, footwear, bags, jewellery, watches, eyewear, and all wearable accessories. Includes menswear, womenswear, childrenswear, traditional dress (batik, kebaya), sportswear, and fashion accessories. |
| Electronics & Gadgets | `TRC-electronics` | Electronics · Cameras & Optics | ACTIVE | Consumer electronics, mobile phones, laptops, tablets, cameras, audio equipment, gaming devices, wearables, smart home devices, and electronic accessories. Cameras & Optics sit as a sub-category here — not a separate top-level — reflecting how Indonesian sellers actually classify on Tokopedia and Shopee. |
| Food, Beverages & Tobacco | `TRC-food-bev` | Food, Beverages & Tobacco | ACTIVE | Packaged food, beverages (non-alcoholic and alcoholic), snacks, condiments, coffee, tea, cooking ingredients, tobacco products. Fresh produce is included but carries additional freshness attributes. Tobacco and alcohol require specific regulatory declarations. |
| Health & Beauty | `TRC-health-beauty` | Health & Beauty | ACTIVE | Skincare, haircare, cosmetics, personal care, OTC vitamins and supplements, consumer-grade medical devices, wellness products, hygiene items. Prescription medicines sit under Pharmacy & Health Retail (TRD-04) and carry stricter attribute requirements. |
| Home & Garden | `TRC-home-garden` | Home & Garden | ACTIVE | Household appliances, kitchen equipment, home décor, lighting, garden tools and supplies, cleaning products, storage and organisation, bedding and bath. |
| Furniture | `TRC-furniture` | Furniture | ACTIVE | Indoor and outdoor furniture — sofas, beds, tables, chairs, wardrobes, shelving — flat-pack and assembled. Kept separate from Home & Garden because of different logistics (oversized/freight), different attributes (dimensions, material, assembly required), and different regulatory treatment (SNI for certain items). |
| Vehicles & Parts | `TRC-automotive` | Vehicles & Parts | ACTIVE | Motorcycles, cars, automotive parts and accessories, tyres, lubricants, helmets, and vehicle care products. Includes new, used, and aftermarket parts. |
| Sporting Goods | `TRC-sports` | Sporting Goods | ACTIVE | Sports equipment, fitness gear, outdoor and adventure equipment, bicycles, water sports, team sports, and sportswear accessories. |
| Toys, Games & Baby | `TRC-toys-baby` | Toys & Games · Baby & Toddler | ACTIVE | Toys, board games, puzzles, educational materials for children, baby clothing, feeding, nursery items, strollers, and baby care products. Merged because seller profiles and buyer journeys significantly overlap in the Indonesian market. Can be split by SWG if regulatory treatment diverges. |
| Books & Media | `TRC-media` | Media | ACTIVE | Physical books, magazines, music CDs, DVDs, Blu-rays, and other physical media. Digital versions are under Digital Goods. |
| Digital Goods | `TRC-digital` | Software | ACTIVE | Software licenses, mobile top-up (pulsa), data packages, PLN token, game credits, digital vouchers, gift cards, e-books, digital subscriptions — all delivered electronically with no physical logistics. |

Primarily serves TRD-06 (B2B Trade & Wholesale) and TRD-07 (Energy & Commodity) business categories. |
| Arts, Crafts & Collectibles | `TRC-arts` | Arts & Entertainment | ACTIVE | Art supplies, craft materials, handmade products, collectibles, antiques, musical instruments, hobby supplies, kerajinan tangan (Indonesian handicrafts). |
| Religious & Ceremonial | `TRC-religious` | Religious & Ceremonial | ACTIVE | Prayer equipment (sajadah, tasbih, mukena), religious texts, ceremonial items, traditional ceremony supplies, items for Lebaran, Natal, Imlek, and other religious observances. Significant category given Indonesia's diverse religious landscape. |
| Luggage & Bags | `TRC-luggage` | Luggage & Bags | ACTIVE | Suitcases, travel bags, backpacks, laptop bags, school bags, and travel accessories. Kept separate from Fashion & Accessories because of different attributes (volume, wheel type, lock type) and different buyer intent (travel utility vs fashion). |
| Animals & Pet Supplies | `TRC-pets` | Animals & Pet Supplies | INACTIVE | Pet food, accessories, grooming, and care products. Recognised but low volume at launch — no attribute schema enforcement yet. Sellers may publish but validation is not applied. |
| Hardware & Tools | `TRC-hardware` | Hardware | INACTIVE | Hand tools, power tools, building materials, plumbing and electrical supplies. Low volume as a distinct top-level at launch — sellers may use Business & Industrial in the interim. |
| Office Supplies | `TRC-office` | Office Supplies | INACTIVE | Stationery, office equipment, paper products, writing instruments. Low volume at launch — sellers may use Business & Industrial. |
| Mature | `TRC-mature` | Mature | GOVERNED | Adult content and products. Blocked pending ION Council policy decision on whether and how adult commerce is permitted, age verification requirements, and BAP rendering obligations. |

## Design Notes

**GPC mapping applies to Trade only.**
GPC L0 is an onboarding crosswalk — never transmitted on the wire. A seller with a GPC code maps to the ION short code at onboarding. Crosswalk table maintained at `registry.ion.id/categories/crosswalk/trade`. Non-Trade sectors have no GPC equivalent — ION defines those independently.

**Why some GPC L0 categories are merged.**
Electronics + Cameras & Optics are merged because Indonesian sellers on Tokopedia and Shopee do not separate them. Toys & Games + Baby & Toddler are merged because seller profiles overlap significantly. Where merging would lose attribute enforcement (Furniture kept separate from Home & Garden) — categories are kept distinct.

**INACTIVE does not mean blocked.**
Sellers can publish under INACTIVE categories. The code is recognised and transmitted. No attribute schema validation is applied at `catalog/publish`. Enforcement will be activated when the SWG defines the schema.

**GOVERNED means blocked.**
Resources cannot be published under GOVERNED categories. Attempts return ION-2005. Unblocked only by ION Council policy decision.

**Cross-sector classification rule.**
When an item could belong to multiple sectors, apply: *what does the buyer end up with?*
- Physical medicine → Trade (`TRC-health-beauty`)
- Doctor consultation → Services (`SVC-healthcare`)
- Hotel room → Hospitality (`HSC-accommodation`)
- Ride → Mobility (`MOC-ride`)

**Short codes are ION-owned.**
GPC vocabulary inspired the naming where applicable. ION governance controls the codes — not Google. If GPC updates, the crosswalk table updates. The ION short codes do not change.
